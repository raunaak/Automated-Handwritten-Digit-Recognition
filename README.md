# Automated-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
The aim of project is to create a regularized neural network to recognize handwritten digits using a training set of 5000 digital images. Feedforward and backpropagation algorithms have been implemented after random initialization using gradient checking and advanced optimization techniques in MATLAB.
